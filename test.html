Also Lisp, Too.</h1><br><h2> What is it; Why should I use it?</h2>I made this project because I was unhappy with Latex, as it&apos;s tough to write short documents in it, but I also didn&apos;t<br>want to use Markdown, because it&apos;d lack many features present in Latex. Flaarc is supposed to have a syntax that<br>resembles normal text as little as possible, that way when you don&apos;t need the features, you don&apos;t have them, but when<br>you do, they&apos;re fairly easy to use. Does this mean you should use it? Probably not, at least not yet. As it is<br><em>very</em> much <b>alpha quality</b>, I wouldn&apos;t recommend it for anything remotely serious. As a fun thing to try? Sure.<br><br><h2> Using It From The CLI</h2>The basic syntax is as follows:<br>(path to flaarc bin) -i (input file) -f (format) -o (output file)<br><br>Please note that while the format and output files aren&apos;t required, as they default to &quot;markdown&quot; and &quot;out.md&quot; respectively, the input file <b>is</b> required.<br><br>Some other options include:<br><ul><li>--help / -h:	print help info</li><li><p style="font-family:'times'"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frog:		Don&apos;t worry about it.</li></ul><br></p><h2> Basic Formatting; Italics, Bold, Superscripts, Subscripts, and Highlights.</h2>Italics can be defined with the text intended to be italicized surrounded by &quot;//&quot;.<br>For example, &quot;//italic text//&quot; makes &quot;<em>italic text</em>&quot;<br><br>Bold is almost identical, but instead of surrounding the text with &quot;//&quot; you surround it with &quot;__&quot;<br>For example, &quot;__bold text__&quot; becomes &quot;<b>bold text</b>&quot;<br><br>If you want to type __ or // <b>without</b> bolding or italicizing the text, precede the chars with a backslash.<br>For example, to type __, you would type \__ instead.<br><br>Superscripts are similar. If you want &quot;x<sup>2</sup>&quot;, you would type &quot;x\<sup>2\</sup>&quot;.<br><br>Subscripts are quite diffent, for this you need to use the &quot;sub&quot; function. For example, to type &quot;H<sub>2</sub>O&quot;, you&apos;d type &quot;H{sub:2}O&quot;. See the &quot;Functions&quot; section for more details on how functions work.<br><br>Highlighting works just like subscripts in that it uses a function, this time the &quot;mark&quot; function. If you want to type &quot;<mark>highlight</mark>&quot;, you&apos;d type &quot;{mark:highlight}&quot;<br><br>Crossout work more like bold and italics, but instead of &quot;__&quot; or &quot;//&quot;, it&apos;s &quot;--&quot;.<br>For example, &quot;--STRIKE--&quot; becomes: &quot;<del>STRIKE</del>&quot;.<br><br><br><h2> Hashes</h2>Hashes are lines that begin with the &apos;#&apos; symbol. There are a few types of hashes:<br><br><br>##: this is a note, a line that starts with two hashes <b>and a space</b> will be discarded by the Flaarc parser.<br><br>#section {name}: make a section, this means make a &lt;h2> tag in the emmitted HTML.<br><br>#title {title}: set the title, this will be the title of the webpage and will be printed at the top, defaults to: &quot;title&quot;. Creative, I know.<br><br>#setfont {font} set the font.<br><br>#image {path_to_image}, include image in document.<br><br>#quote {text to quote} quote the text<br><br>to type a # on its own, ensure it&apos;s preceded by a backslash, like this: \#.<br><br><br><h2> Functions</h2>Functions in Flaarc are just programs. You can make your own functions by copying the executable file into &quot;/lib/flaarc&quot;.<br>The syntax of a function is as follows:<br>{ FUNCTION_NAME_HERE : FUNCTION ARG HERE }<br>Upon seeing this, the parser will try to run a program in the directory /lib/flaarc and will pass the &quot;FUNCTION ARG HERE&quot; section as <b>one</b> CLI argument to the program. Anything the program writes to the standard output will be parsed and then put in the document. Because it&apos;s parsed, it&apos;s syntactically legal to declare variables and even call other functions within the output of the program. <br>Note: if the function is called without a &apos;:&apos;, and therefore no argument to pass to the program, it will run the program without passing anything to it.<br><br>One way this could be used is if you want to be able to import your name, make a title, etc. <b>without</b> having to retype it every time you make a new document, you could make a function that you could call at the beginning of the document that returns the needed text.<br><br>There are reserved functions:<br><ul><li>The list function makes lists.</li><li><p style="font-family:'times'"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The link function makes links.</li><li></p><p style="font-family:'times'"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right function aligns the text to the right.</li><li></p><p style="font-family:'times'"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center function aligns the text to the center.</li><li></p><p style="font-family:'times'"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sub function makes the text a subscript.</li></ul><br></p><h2> Variables</h2>To declare a variable, you need a &quot;#&quot; preceded by a newline, immediately proceeded by the text &quot;define&quot;, then a space, then the name of the variable, then a space, then the content of the variable, and finally, a newline.<br>For example, if you want to declare the variable &quot;x&quot; and set it to contain &quot;this is in x!&quot; you&apos;d type:<br><br>#define x this is in x!<br><br>To use a variable within text, type the variable&apos;s name preceded by a &apos;$&apos;, and proceded by a space. Note that the space will be ignored, if you want a space after a variable, type two spaces.<br>To access the contents of x, we could say:<br><br>I&apos;ve set the variable x to &quot;$x &quot;.<br>This will be converted to:<br>I&apos;ve set the variable x to &quot;this is in x!&quot;.<br><br>Note how the space following $x is present <em>before</em> parsing, but not after.<br><br><br>Some variables are defined by the parser, <b>not</b> the user, however the user can redefine them as they please.<br><br>The following is a full list of the default variables and their values.<br><br><table><tr><th>version</th><th>current of the parser</th></tr><tr><th>year</th><th>current year</th></tr><tr><th>month</th><th>current month</th></tr><tr><th>day</th><th>current day of the month</th></tr><tr><th>invbang</th><th>¬°</th></tr><tr><th>copy</th><th>¬©</th></tr><tr><th>reg</th><th>¬Æ</th></tr><tr><th>deg</th><th>¬∞</th></tr><tr><th>plusmn</th><th>¬±</th></tr><tr><th>micro</th><th>¬µ</th></tr><tr><th>theta</th><th>œ¥</th></tr><tr><th>omega</th><th>Œ©</th></tr><tr><th>alpha</th><th>Œ±</th></tr><tr><th>beta</th><th>Œ≤</th></tr><tr><th>gamma</th><th>Œ≥</th></tr><tr><th>delta</th><th>Œî</th></tr><tr><th>sigma</th><th>Œ£</th></tr><tr><th>pi</th><th>œÄ</th></tr><tr><th>cap_omega</th><th>—†</th></tr><tr><th>bullet</th><th>‚Ä¢</th></tr><tr><th>block</th><th>‚ñà</th></tr><tr><th>light_shade</th><th>‚ñë</th></tr><tr><th>med_shade</th><th>‚ñí</th></tr><tr><th>dark_shade</th><th>‚ñì</th></tr><tr><th>thunder</th><th>‚ö°</th></tr><tr><th>fist</th><th>‚úä</th></tr><tr><th>check</th><th>‚úî</th></tr><tr><th>x</th><th>‚úò</th></tr><tr><th>sparkle</th><th>‚ú®</th></tr><tr><th>cross</th><th>‚ùå</th></tr><tr><th>black_heart</th><th>‚ù§</th></tr><tr><th>smile</th><th>üòÄ</th></tr><tr><th>veryfunny</th><th>üòÇ</th></tr><tr><th>smile2</th><th>üòÉ</th></tr><tr><th>embarrassment</th><th>üòÖ</th></tr><tr><th>cool</th><th>üòé</th></tr><tr><th>smirk</th><th>üòè</th></tr><tr><th>apathy</th><th>üòê</th></tr><tr><th>crying</th><th>üò¢</th></tr><tr><th>ono</th><th>üò≥</th></tr><tr><th>Smile</th><th>üôÇ(yes, they&apos;re case-sensitive)</th></tr><tr><th>nerd</th><th>ü§ì</th></tr><tr><th>brain</th><th>üß†</th></tr><tr><th>cap</th><th>üß¢</th></tr><tr><th>frog</th><th>don&apos;t worry about it</th></tr><tr><th>the following vars are AFTER a char</th><th>IE:a$var</th></tr><tr><th>accute</th><th>x ÃÅ</th></tr><tr><th>overline</th><th>x ÃÖ</th></tr><tr><th>diaresis</th><th>x Ãà</th></tr></table><br><br><br><h2> Tables</h2>Tables are a fuction with the following syntax:<br><br>{table:<br>item 1a|item 1b<br>item 2a|item 2b<br>}<br><br>This would produce the following table:<br><table><tr><th>item 1a</th><th>item 1b</th></tr><tr><th>item 2a</th><th>item 2b</th></tr></table><br><br><br><br><h2> Thank you.</h2>I want to say thank you for showing interest in this hobby project.
