# Flaarc - (F)untional (La)tex-like M(ar)kdown Clone, With Some (C)-like Syntax. Also Lisp, Too.
##  What is it; Why should I use it?
I made this project because I was unhappy with Latex, as it's tough to write short documents in it, but I also didn't
want to use Markdown, becuase it'd lack many features present in Latex. Flaarc is supposed to have a syntax that
resembles normal text as little as possible, that way when you don't need the features, you don't have them, but when
you do, they're fairly easy to use. Does this mean you should use it? Probably not, at least not yet. As it is
*very* much **alpha quality**, I wouldn't recommend it for anything remotely serious. As a fun thing to try? Sure.

##  Italics & Bold.
Italics can be defined with the text intended to be itallicized surounded by "//".
For example, "//italic text//" makes "*italic text*"

Bold is almost identical, but instead of surrounding the text with "//" you surround it with "\_\_"
For example, "\_\_bold text\_\_" becomes "**bold text**"

If you want to type \_\_ or // **without** bolding or italicizing the text, precede the chars with a backslash.
For example, to type \_\_, you would type \\\_\_ instead.
